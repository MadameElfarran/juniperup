+ REMOTE WAYPOINTS - Live In-game World map.
+ Added some relaxing custom menu music  :D
+ Added a KEYBIND HELPER menu (on pause menu).
+ Added a neat update box that refreshes via web.

## Fixes:
+ Removed debugify; causes texture loss on custom WoC resource pack models (no idea why)

## Issues:
- SKIN SHUFFLE carousel renders in game, but refuses to render in the main menu.
- REBINDMYKEYS shows conflicts that don't actually conflict.
- PLAYERS appear online in the player list even after leaving the server?
- Attempted to add 'speech bubbles' but there was a mod conflict; will figure out later
